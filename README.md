# beautiful-academic-writing

Academic publications spread knowledge across researchers 
and contribute to improving our general understanding to this world. 
Although scientific articles may be mathematically intensive or full of intricate terminologies, 
the language can be fluid, elegant, comprehensible, even beautiful, 
to boost efficiency of information exchange and peer discussions. 
In addition, the literature is permanently archived to stimulate students' interest, 
which has remarkable long-term value. 

These are my principles of writing a beautiful article: 
- The title should be as compact and direct as possible.
- The content should be as clear and self-descriptive as possible.
- The language should be as plain as possible.
- The case studies (if have) should be as minimum as possible.

According to the "golden rule" above, 
I keep a recod of high-quality publications I have read, 
grouped by respective disciplines. 

## Statistics

> Abadie, Alberto, and Guido W. Imbens. "Matching on the estimated propensity score." Econometrica 84.2 (2016): 781-807.

This paper derived an adjusted large sample distribution of propensity score matching estimators, 
and introduced widely used propensity score matching with clarity. 

## Wind Energy

> Shourangiz-Haghighi, Alireza, et al. "Developing more efficient wind turbines: A survey of control challenges and opportunities." IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine 14.4 (2020): 53-64.

This is a magazine paper focusing on educational introduction of wind turbine control and wind farm topology. 
Although the breadth and depth of the survey are limited, the langauge is easy-to-follow and appealing to general public.
